I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct Tailwind directives in my `tailwind.config.js` file and the necessary `@tailwind` directives in my CSS file, but some classes simply had no effect.  This was inconsistent; some classes worked perfectly while others were ignored. I checked browser's developer console and the classes were present in the HTML, but the CSS rules weren't being applied. The issue appeared only in the production build, and the classes functioned normally during development.
